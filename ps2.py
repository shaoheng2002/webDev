def traffic_light_detection(img_in, radii_range):
    """Finds the coordinates of a traffic light image given a radii
    range.

    Use the radii range to find the circles in the traffic light and
    identify which of them represents the yellow light.

    Analyze the states of all three lights and determine whether the
    traffic light is red, yellow, or green. This will be referred to
    as the 'state'.

    It is recommended you use Hough tools to find these circles in
    the image.

    The input image may be just the traffic light with a white
    background or a larger image of a scene containing a traffic
    light.

    Args:
        img_in (numpy.array): image containing a traffic light.
        radii_range (list): range of radii values to search for.

        tuple: 2-element tuple containing:
        coordinates (tuple): traffic light center using the (x, y)
                             convention.
